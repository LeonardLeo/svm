# Support Vector Machine
The dataset (Social_Network_Ads) uses the variables UserID, Gender, Age, and Estimated Salary to determine if a customer goes ahead to purchase a predict after seeing the ad. We solved this classification problem by using a Support Vector Machine(SVM) Classifier and created a model to predict if new customers given the parameters, their likelihood to equally make a purchase. The goal here is to help the company understand how to target their ads in order to recieve maximum returns on investment. We evaluated the model performance using a confusion matrix to determine recall and precision. Optimization of the models performance was done using kfold cross validation. Finally, we visualized the results of the training set and the test set.
